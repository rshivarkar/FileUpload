# FileUpload
FileUpload

This is MVC project and sample code to upload and parse csv and excel files.

I am using TextFieldParser for csv and DocumentFormat.OpenXml for xml files.
Sample code will take file as input and convert data into datatable.

This is generic code and will work with any file with any columns etc.
